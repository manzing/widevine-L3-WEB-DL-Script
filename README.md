# widevine-L3-WEB-DL-Script with dual audio tracks support

### Version fran√ßaise ici :
https://github.com/manzing/widevine-L3-WEB-DL-Script/blob/French-English-V2/README_FR.md

This is a script created to WEB-DL L3 Widevine Content.



Original script by Parnexcodes (thanks for his work !) is here :
https://github.com/parnexcodes/widevine-L3-WEB-DL-Script

This modified script add proper support for 2 audio tracks (still allow a single track), intended for french and english (or other languages but MKV tracks tags would be incorrects so please modify the script / or resulting MKV as you need if you want to use another language).

A batch file is provided to make things easier and as "-id" argument is mandatory for dual audio tracks.

This branch will be more deeply modified and will (maybe) offer an easier command interface, and ability to prepare several download.
If possible, a beginning of automation support will be made.

Please note : I am not a developer at all, so don't expect anything great, this is just for fun :)

## New in this script : 
* Support of dual audio tracks, support single track as you wish.
* New mandatory argument -k to specify the json file name. Why ? To allow to prepare several json files named according to each video. You don't have to prepare and reload the script each time.
* Using download.bat you have to type in the filename of your json file. This name will be used for the output video
 eg : mymovie.json will output a mymovie.mkv file
* With download.bat, -id argument is implicit and you have to choose video quality and audio track(s). 
* New argument -es allow loading of external subtitles that will be added to the mkv file. Support SRT files only and the sub MUST be named accordingly to the json file.
* Temporary files are deleted after merging.
